## Code Exploration Policy

Always use jCodeMunch-MCP for code navigation. Never fall back to Read, Grep, Glob, or Bash for code exploration.
**Exception:** use `Read` when you are about to edit a file — the harness requires a `Read` before `Edit`/`Write`. Use jCodeMunch to *find and understand* code, then `Read` only the file you are changing.

This server runs the **front door** surface: three tools reach every jCodeMunch capability, so the tool list stays small and the catalogue is fetched only when you need it.

**Start any session:**
1. `order { "action": "resolve_repo", "args": { "path": "." } }` — confirm the project is indexed. If it is not: `order { "action": "index_folder", "args": { "path": "." } }`

**Then, for any task:**
- Know what you want → `order { "action": "<name>", "args": { ... } }`
- Know the goal, not the tool → `route { "query": "your task in a sentence" }` picks the action and shapes the arguments
- Want to see what exists → `menu { "query": "what you are trying to do" }` returns matching actions with example arguments
- Want the whole catalogue and the usage rules → `jcodemunch_guide`

`menu` and `jcodemunch_guide` list every action this server can run, including ones absent from your tool list. That is expected: the front door is the way to call them.

**Interpreting results:**
- A search proves absence only when the scan is citable: `_meta.verdict.evidence_ref` holds an `absent:` token, or, where `_meta.verdict` is not shown, `_meta.absence_evidence.citable` is `true`. Then report the gap; do not re-search with different wording. A `no_implementation_found` verdict, a `state` of `absent` or an empty result is not proof on its own: read the note or `absence_blocked_by`, re-index if it names the index, then search again.
- `source: ""` alongside `source_status` means the body could not be read, not that the symbol is empty.

**After editing files:**
- With PostToolUse hooks installed (Claude Code), edited files are reindexed automatically.
- Otherwise `order { "action": "register_edit", "args": { "paths": [...] } }` after an edit, batched for bulk changes.

**Announce your model once per session** so the server can size its answers: `announce_model { "model": "<your-model-id>" }`.
